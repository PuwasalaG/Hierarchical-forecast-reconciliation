# Probabilistic-Forecast-in-Hierarchical-Time-Series

- In discussion after section 2.3 perhaps add references (or examples) of actual organisations that produced incoherent forecasts. **George** and **Rob** can probably do in 5 minutes

- Find refence that projection projects any matrix in its image onto itself.  If not a book, wikipedia will do **Puwasala to do**

- Do we drop proof of theorem 3.1 (as it is) and only keep geometric proof  **For everyone to think about**

- Sit down with van Erven and Culigari proofs and Wickremasuriya proofs and compare.  **Puwasala and Tas** after Tas returns

- New pictures: Something like figure 5 but with all points obliquely projected to coherent subspace.  Next to it Something like figure 5 but with all points orthogonally projected to coherent subspace. Perhaps a four panel plot with figure 4, figure 5 and these two plots.  **Puwasala to do**

- Discuss exactly how we define unbiasedness. **For everyone to think about**

- Run simulations with log linear model and write up **Puwasala to do**

- Write Introduction **Tas to do**
