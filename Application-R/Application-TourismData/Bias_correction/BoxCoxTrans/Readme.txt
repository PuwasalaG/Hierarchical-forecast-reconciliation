Here we fit univariate ARIMA models for the Box-Cox transformed data
The back transformed data will be biased and we bias adjust to get 
unbiased point forecasts.

Box-Cox transformation lambda is selected from Guerrero method 

Set-1 constrained the lambda to be in (0,1)
Set-2 constrained the lambda to be in (-0.5,2)
